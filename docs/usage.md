# Use it

This page explains how a command is built, and how an agent uses the tool. Read it before your first command.

## The profile comes first

A profile is a name you choose for one account. It is the first word of every command that uses an account:

```sh
acme-crm personal config show
```

`ACME_CRM_PROFILE=personal` does the same for one shell session. No profile is ever assumed, not even the only one: a
command without one stops with exit code 2 and lists the profiles on this computer.

## Output for scripts

Every command except `mcp serve` on stdin and stdout takes `--json`, and prints one JSON value on stdout. Errors are JSON on stderr, with a code to branch
on. The [command reference](commands.md) lists the codes.

## Agents

`acme-crm skill install` puts the tool's skill where Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI and OpenClaw look for it.
`acme-crm skill install --for hermes` also adds that folder to Hermes Agent's own settings, so a bare `skill install`
leaves Hermes out. `acme-crm personal mcp serve` serves the profile's commands over MCP, on stdin and stdout:

```sh
claude mcp add acme-crm -- acme-crm personal mcp serve
```

The server offers every command, the ones that write included. The profile's permissions decide what runs; see
[settings](configuration.md#permissions).

For ChatGPT and Claude in the browser,
`acme-crm personal mcp serve --http --public-url https://laptop.example.ts.net` serves on `127.0.0.1` (port 8765, or
`--port`) behind your own tunnel. A browser app logs in with a one-time code that the command prints;
`acme-crm personal mcp revoke` ends every login. `acme-crm personal mcp server start` runs the same
server in the background, `mcp server status` shows its port, the login code and the apps logged in, and
`mcp server stop` ends it.
